# Lexicographic-Static-Text-Analysis

Enter in the number of letters you have in one bag from A-Z, separated by spaces and this program will figure out about how many alphabet bags you need to write the text file entirely in those letters. My text file is the Bee Movie script, but you can change the text file to whatever!
